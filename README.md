# XYZ-Cleanouts

XYZ-Cleanouts is a web project that showcases a fully insured junk removal service. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and Sass, with a design inspired by a free Figma template. While this project is not for a real company, it has the potential to be used as a template for an actual junk removal business.
